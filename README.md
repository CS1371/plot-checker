# Plot Checker

The `Plot Checker` is a function that the student uses to check that their
plots were the same (or not). Critically, this checker is to be run _by the student_.

## Requirements

- **If it passes the checker, it must pass the autograder**
- **If it passes the autograder, it _should_ pass the checker**

In other words, the checker must be as or more stringent as the autograder.
